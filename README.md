# Acknowledgement
This note is made by [Typst]("https://github.com/typst/typst"), built with [shiroa]("https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/shiroa").

*shiroa* (_Shiro A_, or _The White_, or _云笺_) is a simple tool for creating modern online (cloud) books in pure typst. It has similar use cases as [mdBook]("https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html"), which is ideal for creating product or API documentation, tutorials, course materials or anything that requires a clean, easily navigable and customizable presentation.
